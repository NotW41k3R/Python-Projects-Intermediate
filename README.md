# Python Projects – Intermediate

A collection of intermediate-level Python projects developed as part of the 100 Days of Python course.
This repository focuses on transitioning from basic scripting to structured, object-oriented applications, interactive programs, and small-scale systems with persistence and external integrations.

Each project applies multiple concepts together, emphasizing code organization, reusability, and real-world workflows.


## Topics covered

* Object-oriented programming (classes, methods, initializers, inheritance)
* Python instances, state management, and attribute control
* Modular code, imports, module aliasing, and external libraries
* Event-driven programming and game development with Turtle
* Desktop GUI development using Tkinter
* File I/O, directory handling, and local persistence
* Reading and writing CSV files and working with JSON data
* List and dictionary comprehensions
* Error handling using `try`, `except`, and `raise`
* Sending emails with SMTP and handling date/time logic
* Introduction to Pandas for data handling
* Strongly dynamic typing and function argument packing/unpacking
* Deploying and hosting Python applications using PythonAnywhere


## Project style

* Multi-file, modular project structures
* Object-oriented design with clear class responsibilities
* Event-driven logic and GUI-based applications
* Practical use of files, data formats, and external services
* Incremental refactors and improved versions preserved


## Purpose

This repository documents the shift from beginner-level exercises to intermediate software design, focusing on building maintainable, extensible Python applications while integrating real-world tools, data, and workflows.


Note: Run the games from inside its project folder to avoid image path errors (e.g. `python main.py` while in `/snake_game`).
This is because the background image (`img.gif`) uses a relative path.
