# Password Manager
Completed on Day 29 of 100 Days of Python

A GUI based password manager app built with **Tkinter**, allowing users to generate strong passwords, save them securely into a local '.txt' file, and automatically copy them to the clipboard for easy use.
In this project I revisited and improved my Day 5 password generator, integrating it into a full-fledged GUI based application that handles user input, message boxes, and file operations seamlessly.

Skills learned: GUI design with Tkinter, handling user input fields, using message boxes for feedback, file management with Python, function modularity, dynamic password generation, list comprehensions, shuffling and joining lists, clipboard automation with `pyperclip`, and real-world app structuring.
