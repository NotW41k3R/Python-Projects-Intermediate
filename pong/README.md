# Pong
Completed on Day 22 of 100 Days of Python

A recreation of the classic Pong arcade game where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth across the screen. The ball bounces off walls and paddles with realistic angle variations, increasing speed with each hit, live scoreboard and the game resets when a player misses.

Skills learned: Class design, object interactions, collision detection, coordinate geometry, randomization for realistic behavior, event listeners (`onkey`), animation loops, and clean OOP-based game structure.
