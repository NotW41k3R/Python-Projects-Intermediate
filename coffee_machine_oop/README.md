# Coffee Machine (OOP Edition)
Completed on Day 16 of 100 Days of Python

An Object-Oriented version of the Coffee Machine program where the user can order drinks, insert coins (quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies), and receive their drink with the correct change.
This version is built using predefined classes and methods, making the machine modular, maintainable, and closer to how real-world applications are structured.

Skills learned: Classes and objects, methods and attributes, object composition, modular programming, encapsulation, abstraction, and clean code structure.
