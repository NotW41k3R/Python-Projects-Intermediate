# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter
Completed on Day 26 of 100 Days of Python

A simple program that converts user input into its NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent. It reads data from a CSV file using Pandas, creates a dictionary through both comprehension and DataFrame methods, and then maps each character of the user’s input to its corresponding NATO code word.

This project reinforces how to work with real-world data using Pandas and how to apply dictionary and list comprehensions effectively.

**Skills learned:** Reading CSV files with Pandas, setting DataFrame indexes, converting DataFrames to dictionaries, nested dictionary comprehension, list comprehension, data iteration.
