# Turtle Race and Etch-a-Sketch
Completed on Day 19 of 100 Days of Python

A fun set of mini-projects using the Turtle Graphics library â€” the Turtle Race, where multiple turtles compete in a randomized race, and Etch-a-Sketch, an interactive drawing app controlled by keyboard input.

Skills learned: Multiple object instances, object state management, higher-order functions, event-driven programming, user input handling, and interactive graphics using the Turtle module.
