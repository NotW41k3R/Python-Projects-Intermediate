# Password Manager V2
Completed on Day 30 of 100 Days of Python

An upgraded version of the password manager that I created on Day 29. This version improves on how the data is saved, moving from `.txt` format to a structured `.json` format. It now includes a search feature to look up saved passwords. It also improves reliability with the use of try/except statements to handle common errors.

Skills learned: GUI design with Tkinter, JSON-based data storage, file persistence and management, error handling with try/except, handling user inputs, modular function design, user feedback through message boxes, clipboard automation with pyperclip, and implementing search functionality.
