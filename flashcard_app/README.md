# Flashy – French Flashcard App
Completed on Day 31 of 100 Days of Python

A simple flashcard application built using Tkinter to help learn French vocabulary. The app displays a French word on a card, automatically flips it after a delay to reveal the English meaning, and allows the user to mark words as known or unknown.

Known words are removed from the learning pool and saved persistently, so progress is retained across sessions. The app uses CSV files for data storage and handles missing progress files using error handling.

Skills learned: GUI development with Tkinter, timed callbacks using after(), state management in GUI applications, file persistence, random data selection, and basic UI logic for interactive applications.
