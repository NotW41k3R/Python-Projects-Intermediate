# Mail Merge Project
Completed on Day 24 of 100 Days of Python

A Python automation project that generates personalized invitation letters by reading a list of names and inserting each one into a letter template. The program reads the base letter and list of invitees from input files, replaces the placeholder `[name]` with each personâ€™s name, and saves the customized letters into an output folder automatically.

Skills learned: File handling, string manipulation, file paths, loops, working with context managers (`with` statements), and practical automation for text generation.
