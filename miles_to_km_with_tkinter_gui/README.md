# Miles to Kilometers (Tkinter Edition)
Completed on Day 27 of 100 Days of Python

A simple program that demonstrates how a Command-Line Interface (CLI) app can be transformed into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using **Tkinter**, Python’s built-in GUI toolkit. Instead of relying on text-based input and output in the console, it has an input fields, labels, and buttons to create an interactive experience.

Skills learned: Tkinter basics, window creation, layout management with grid, widget configuration (Entry, Label, Button), event-driven programming, and connecting GUI elements with functional logic.
