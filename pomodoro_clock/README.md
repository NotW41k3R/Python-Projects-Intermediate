# Pomodoro Timer (Tkinter Edition)
Completed on Day 28 of 100 Days of Python

A graphical Pomodoro Timer application built using **Tkinter**, where users can manage their work and break sessions following the Pomodoro productivity technique. The program cycles through work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks automatically, visually displaying the countdown on a timer interface and tracking completed sessions with checkmarks.

Skills learned: GUI design with Tkinter, event-driven logic, widget configuration, canvas manipulation, image rendering, callback scheduling, state management using global variables, and implementing real-time countdown functionality.
