# Hirst Painting (Turtle Graphics Edition)
Completed on Day 18 of 100 Days of Python

A graphical art project created using the Turtle Graphics module in Python, inspired by Damien Hirst’s dot paintings. The program generates colorful dot patterns in a grid layout, with colors extracted from real images using the `colorgram` module.

In the process, I explored Turtle’s drawing mechanics by creating shapes, spirographs, and randomized color grids — learning how to control position, heading, and movement precisely to design structured yet artistic visuals.

Skills learned: Turtle graphics, loops and coordinate systems, RGB color handling with `colormode(255)`, color extraction using the `colorgram` module, modular programming, creative coding, and fine control over turtle movement and headings.
