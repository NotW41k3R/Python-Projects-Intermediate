# Turtle Crossing
Completed on Day 23 of 100 Days of Python

A Frogger-inspired game where the player controls a turtle attempting to cross multiple lanes of traffic without getting hit. Cars move at increasing speeds with each level, and collision detection ensures fair, accurate gameplay. The game features clearly defined road lanes, breathing zones, and includes custom car icons and a background image for visual polish.

Skills learned: Advanced collision detection, structured game loops, dynamic object management, visual lane-based design, scaling game difficulty, sprite customization (custom car icons and background), and a deeper understanding of event-driven OOP game design.
