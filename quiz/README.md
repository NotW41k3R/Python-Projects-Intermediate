# Quiz
Completed on Day 17 of 100 Days of Python

A Quiz made using Object Oriented Programming where questions are stored in a question bank and presented one by one to the user. The program keeps track of the user's score, checks answers, and displays the final result at the end. This project reinforces the fundamentals of OOP by structuring the quiz logic into reusable and maintainable components.

Skills learned: Creating classes, defining attributes and methods, using object composition, encapsulation, and modular programming for clean and scalable code.
