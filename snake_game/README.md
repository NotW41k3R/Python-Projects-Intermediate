# Snake Game 
Completed on Day 20 and 21 of 100 Days of Python

A fully functional version of the classic Snake Game built using the Turtle graphics module. The player controls the snakeâ€™s direction to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. The game features smooth movement, screen updates, dyanamic score and global highscore, and modular code organization across multiple classes.

Skills learned: Screen updating and time-based animation, class inheritance, event-driven programming with `onkey()`, modular code design, and a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming and how different classes interact to form a complete application.
